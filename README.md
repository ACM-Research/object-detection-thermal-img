# Object Detection Modelling with Thermal Imaging

Thermal imaging involves extracting visual data in instances where real-life imaging and night-life vision are limited.

Their applications in self-driving cars and intelligent car driving system are inherently intuitive. 
FLIR, a company that makes cameras for infrared and thermal imaging, has recently released a brand new camera that does thermal imaging in a manner that self-driving cars can utilize.

FLIR have released a dataset from this camera which can be accessed on the website here: https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/

Using this dataset and models, new and old, that exist in the Computer Vision and Modelling, we will aim to implement object detection with these datasets in order to develop techniques and models to help self-driving and intelligent cars.
